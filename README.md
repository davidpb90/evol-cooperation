# evol-cooperation

A program developed for my bachelor's in Physics final project. With the user interface it is possible to look at the evolution of  populations with various cooperative behaviors organized in different spatial structures. It is lets the user obtain the raw data related to the population sizes at each time step. The populations evolve according to Moran's process under different game models.
